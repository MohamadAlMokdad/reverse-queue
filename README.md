# Reverse Sequence with Stack and Queue ðŸ”„

This Python program demonstrates how to reverse a sequence of numbers (or any sequence) using **Stack** and **Queue** data structures. The program takes an input sequence of space-separated numbers, processes them using a stack and a queue, and then reverses their order.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Reverses a sequence using **Stack** (LIFO) and **Queue** (FIFO).
- Works for any space-separated sequence (numbers, words, etc.).
- Outputs the reversed sequence in a single line.
## ðŸ’» Usage

1. **Input**: The program will prompt you to enter a sequence of space-separated numbers. For example:
    ```
    Enter a sequence of numbers (space-separated): 5 4 3 2 1
    ```

2. **Output**: After processing the sequence using Stack and Queue, the output will be:
    ```
    Reversed sequence: 12345
    ```

### Example Run:
```bash
Enter a sequence of numbers (space-separated): 9 8 7 6 5
Reversed sequence: 56789
